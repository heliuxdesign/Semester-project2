# Semester-project2

In This project I have created an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections.
Both sections are populated by a Strapi API.

## Running Strapi-api locally 
For the web-page to run properly you need to have the strapi-api running by following these steps:
Clone this repository: https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2 

To run the strapi-api
Move to the cloned directory and run the following commands:

npm install  
npm run develop

The admin panel will open at http://localhost:1337/admin.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or terminal.

## Get the web-page running locally

Clone this repository and move to the cloned directory.  
Run the following command:  
live-server

The webpage will then be running locally.
