# Semester-project2

In This project I have created an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections.
Both sections are populated by a Strapi API.


Clone this https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2 first

Strapi Project
To run the project:

npm install
npm run develop
The admin panel will open at http://localhost:1337/admin.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or termi
